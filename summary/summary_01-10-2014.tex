\subsubsection{Meeting with supervisors}
The supervisors commented on our group contract. We need to improve it, it has to be more detailed and clear (to avoid future conflicts).\\
We also talked about how we could proceed with the project. We then talked about some innovations tools to help us with that.

\subsubsection{Next meeting}
Next meeting will be tomorrow (2. october) starting at 12.15.\\
Agenda for next meeting is: to improve group contract and what we deside for agenda at the beginning at the meeting.

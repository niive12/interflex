\subsection*{2. October}
\subsubsection{Agenda}
\begin{itemize}
\item Brainstorm
\item Eliminate ideas
\item Subject
\item Revisit group contract
\end{itemize}
The moderator was Nikolaj.
Everyone was present at the meeting.
The meeting took 4 hours.
\subsubsection{Brainstorm}
The group needed a more specific subject to work with.
All the ideas that have been made during the previous samples had been influenced by the overall theme: Waste sorting.
This brainstorm started with the intelligent tool and included everything we could make with this beyond waste sorting.
\subsubsection{Eliminate ideas}
To eliminate ideas the group was divided into two groups to further specify the ideas.
Then the ideas were presented to everyone and a subject was picked by voting.

\subsubsection{Subject}
The chosen subject was a welding robot.
The idea is to have a two part detection system so the user can paint (or otherwise mark) where the robot should weld.
When the tool gets closer to the marked area it should be able to detect where two pieces of metal is joined.
Then it should weld the area where it is marked and is joined.

This would allow the user to mark a lot of different object and the robot can adapt to different shapes and forms.

\subsubsection{Group contract}
The group contract was revisited in order to be more specific to avoid imprecise phrasing. 
Each member signed the contract and it is now official.

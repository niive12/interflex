Group meetings have the following agenda:
\begin{itemize}
 \item What have each member been doing since the previous meeting.
 \item What problems have you encountered.
 \item Preparation for the next council meeting.
 \item What should we do before the next meeting.
 \item When is the next meeting.
\end{itemize}

Our ambition for this project is to make a solid project.
We expect ending with a grade 10-12.

We expect each member to work at least 8 hours per week.

We measure performance of each member with the G-pit tool.

If people don't perform at least 10\% at the G-pit they get a warning.

Attending: We only meet when we schedule a meeting. 
If a specific member is not attending, whether it is attending in person or mentally, the group can decide to give a warning.
If there is no sign of improvement the supervisors will get involved. If more warnings should be given, the supervisors can exclude that member.

Let the group know if you are late. (Either by phone or Facebook).

Deadlines: The deadlines are presented and gone through doing the weekly meetings.

Ideas: Ideas belong to the group, which means that each member has ownership.

At least 6 people should be present for an important decision to be made.

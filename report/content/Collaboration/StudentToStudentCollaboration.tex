\subsection{Student to Student Teaching}
In the group we are all studying different fields, hence we also have different interests and expert skills. 
These expert skills were shared through Student to Student teaching. 

The subject and reflections of the Student to Student teaching are found in appendix \ref{student-to-student}.

It has been difficult to find subject possible for Student to Student teaching, which was also relevant to the project. We did, for the most parts, manage to find suitable subjects which were in some way related to the project. 

Student to Student has given a general idea about several of the things we worked with in the project. It gave us an idea about what the other represented educations are about. Also, it was a personal challenge, and good training in conveying our knowledge.

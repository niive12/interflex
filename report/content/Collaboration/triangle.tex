In order to learn more about each group member a competence triangle was created (figure \ref{fig_triangle}). 
The competence triangle separates competences that are on a personal, theoretical and experience level. 
This is done to get a better understanding of how people view themselves and what their education involves.
Each member wrote down 2-3 things about themselves and each item and its relation to the project was discussed.

The theoretical part is covered by many technical fields, for instance math, physics and programming. 
This signals a strong area of knowledge when it comes to calculating and developing solutions. 
This was used in the idea generation to what kind of product we could come up with when we combined our theoretical knowledge.
We learned from our experiences which roles that was suitable for each member. 

The experience section covers communication by teaching and debating, but also experience from jobs. 
This can come in handy when you have to realize an idea. 

While everything listed in the competence triangle was things that we could provide, it also showed what we couldn't provide.
We didn't have anyone with skills in making a business plan and we didn't have anyone who knew much about idea generating.

We decided to overcome the business planning by sticking to a model and letting that dictate what we should investigate.

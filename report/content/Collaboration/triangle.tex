In order to learn more about each group member a competence triangle was created (figure \ref{fig_triangle}). 
The competence triangle separates competences that are on a personal, theoretical and experience level. 
This is done to get a better understanding of how people view themselves and what their education involves.
Each member wrote down 2-3 things about themselves and each item and its relation to the project was discussed.
The group has a lot of math and programming focused people, but lacks business oriented people.

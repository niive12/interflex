Table \ref{belbintable} is based on the results of the individual tests, which is also reflected by the spider web chart on figure \ref{belbinspider}. 
The table shows the strong and weak roles for the team profiles.

It is very clear that the group has a major potential when it comes to developing solutions to perfection, while being able to investigate the different possibilities. 
This could be explained by the amount of specialists in the group.

It is also very clear that the group lacks drive and a key person to set the pace of the work processes. 
The group has to be aware that the beginning of project  can potentially cause issues. This is due to the lack of Plants and Resource Investigators. 
The Plants provide creativity and innovation, while the Resource Investigators validates the possibility of and idea.

It is also very clear that the group lacks drive and a key person to set the pace of the work processes. 
The groups has to be aware that the beginning of the project can potentially cause issues. 
This is due to the lack of Plants and Resource Investigators. 
The Plants provide creativity and innovation, while the Resource Investigators validates the possibility of an idea.

The weaknesses have been identified and it was time to take action to make our actions clear for the group. 
These allowable weaknesses as seen above is not always preventable. 
There has been an awareness about the lack of drive, from the beginning. 
This has led to long discussions about minor subjects, which required less attention than it got. 
For instance, the few shapers in the group has to be aware of their role. 
 
%This is due to the missing Plants who provide creativity and innovation to the group, together with the resource investigators who makes sure the actual ideas are possible at all.
 
%Since we already encountered difficulties in the beginning of the project, it is obvious that the group is missing ideas to work with. That could also explain why we decided to go with the basic idea that was described in the project introduction papers.

%The strengths and weaknesses can all be related to the group-SWOT test.

\subsection{SWOT}

Table \ref{SWOT-table} shows the SWOT-analysis of the team. 
By looking at a SWOT analysis of each person we can determine what threats can be resolved by a another group member.
When there is a strength that is used to compensate for a weakness both are removed from the list. 
In the end we can make an overview of what skills we have as a team and what threats we have to deal with.

We combined that with the strengths and weaknesses from the Belbin and compared that to the 3 top and bottom roles, so we extracted some ideas from there.

The strengths leads us to discover what possibilities and the weakness leads us to discover our threats. 

We are very good at solving and working with problems, but at the same time we are having difficulties finding and or creating these problems. 
This means that the team should be aware of difficulties especially in the beginning of the project.

We are not good at ending discussions.
To overcome this we remind ourselves to stop a discussion when it reaches a limit of 30 minutes.
If we haven't resolved anything at that point we go into smaller groups so we can focus on smaller problems and to minimize group discussions.
This process breaks down issues to smaller parts so we don't end up arguing over the overall project every time we have to design a small part.

To finish small projects we delegate and spend the time to make sure that list of unfinished projects is kept to a minimum.

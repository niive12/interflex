\subsection{SWOT}

Table \ref{SWOT-table} shows the combination of the SWOT-analysis of the individual members. 
By combining each SWOT-analysis into one, we get a very good overview of the strengths and weaknesses for the group.

By looking at the two boxes with strengths and opportunities we see that there are a lot of words and sentences that indicate that our team can solve and work with problems, as well as being structured.
The two boxes that contain weaknesses and threats indicates that the team is marked by stubbornness, non-shapers and non-innovative members. 
This implies that the team will probably  have a hard time generating ideas and to start work on a problem. 
%Hvis man ser på kollonnerne med styrker og muligheder fremkommer der mange ord og sætninger som indikere at vores gruppe er god til at løse og arbejde med problemer/opgaver og tillige vil være rimelig struktureret.
%Kollonnerne for svagheder og trusler fortæller at gruppen bærer præg af stædighed, ikke-startere og ikke-innovative medlemmer. Dette indikere at gruppen nok for svært ved at finde på ideér og have svært ved at starte op på problemer/opgaver.

It is a kind of a paradox when we take a look at the strengths and weaknesses of the team. 
We are very good at solving and working with problems, but at the same time we are having difficulties finding and or creating these problems. 
This means that the team should be aware of difficulties especially in the beginning of the project.

We are not good at ending discussions.
To overcome this we remind ourselves to stop a discussion when it reaches a limit of 30 minutes.
If we haven't resolved anything at that point we go into smaller groups so we can focus on smaller problems and to minimize group discussions.
%Når man ser på gruppens styrker og svagheder kan det være lidt forurolingede at vi er rigtig gode til at løse problemer/opgaver, og samtidigt har vi svært ved at starte op og eller finde disse problemer/opgaver. Dette betyder at vi skal være særlig opmærksom på opstarten af vores projekt, for når vi bliver klart over vores opgave skal vi nok løse den.

%Introduction to Collaboration

Throughout the project the group have done several things to improve and strengthen the collaboration. A strong collaboration is important for several different reasons. First, it is important that we know each others strengths and weaknesses, so we know which areas we are the stronges and should help, and in which areas we need to be the helping one. It is also important that we know each others personalities, so there is room for everyone in the group. If everyone is comfortable expressing their oppinion a better product will come out in the end. The things that have been done to improve collaboration is listed and described in this section.

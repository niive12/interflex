%Introduction to Collaboration

Throughout the project the group has done several activities to improve and strengthen the collaboration. 
Good collaboration is crucial for several different reasons. 
First, it is important that we can identify each others strengths and weaknesses, so that we know which areas to have in mind when cooperating. 
Knowing each others personalities helps us collaborate. 
If everyone is comfortable expressing their opinion a better product will come out in the end. The things that have been done to improve collaboration are listed and described in this section.

\subsection{Conclusion on Collaboration}

The group has done several things to create good collaboration. A group contract has been made to make sure the group agreed on the expectations to the project. The weaknesses has been explored through SWOT and Belbin. The strengths pointed out through the same, and also the competence triangle. Analysis tools have been used to keep track of the status on groupwork and collaboration.

We have been able to identify the potential risks and we have taken action to neutralize them. 

The main issues are that we have problems finishing discussions and staying focused and on track. We have been aware of the problems from the beginning, and though they are still our weaknesses, the problems have become less through the process.

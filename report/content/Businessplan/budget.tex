\section{Budget}
\label{budget_label}
The budget has been divided into a development budget and a operations budget. The development budget\todo{ref to full budget in appendix} shows how much money we need for our concept to be ready for production. The main costs of the development budget is the wages, establishing, rent, interest of bank loan and some unexpected costs. 
The basis: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] the wage is that the team (7 persons) will be working full-time (160,33 h/month) to a wage equal to the minimum salary for a third year student (172 DDK/h\footnote{http://english.ida.dk/salary/minimum-salary}).
\item[-] for establishing is covering office fittings (37000 DKK) and application for a patent/registration.
\item[-] for rent is a price check for renting commercial premises in Odense, Denmark. Premises with plenty of space is available at 5000 DKK.\footnote{http://www.lokalebasen.dk/leje/erhvervslokaler}
\item[-] for the interest of the bank loan of 7 \% is that the concept is with some risks , if there were no risks the interest would be higher. 
\end{itemize} 
The size of the loan is set to fit costs. So after a year of development we will owe the bank 2.95 mio. DKK.


\subsection{Introduction [better name needed]}
For the success of this product it is crucial that the price stays competitive. Offline programming methods currently in use today\footnote{Information courtesy of Valk Welding} costs 100.000 DKK, software and training included. Our product should stay within this budget or offer significant advantages over competition.
\subsection{Bill of Materials}
Below is a rough estimate of the budget for each component needed to produce the robot:

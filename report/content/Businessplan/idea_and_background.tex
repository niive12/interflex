\subsection{Idea and background}
This section briefly covers a description of the problem that we are trying to solve, how we are going to solve it, which customers that could have an interest in it and how we would benefit from it and create profit.

Also it will contain a short presentation of the team and why we are the perfect fit for this start up company.

\subsubsection{Problem}
Basically the problem involves flexibility within the area of industrial processing. Reprogramming robots is common when a new task is up and within the field of robotic welding it is often required to do so. Usually these movement coordinates of a welding robot is stored in recipes, but those cannot handle new tasks. Adaptability and precision is the major key words when it comes to welding tasks for industrial robots.

\subsubsection{Solution}
We provide a solution to the problem mentioned above, which do not require programming. The product itself is an add-on for welding robots, that allows the robot to detect the areas to weld by itself. The add-on will provide coordinates, used to create a welding-path for the robot. 

The product consists of a micro computer, which is used to make  calculations based on input from a camera and a laser range scanner. 

\subsubsection{Customer}
Relevant customers are companies who are already in the zone of robotic welding, companies who could be interested in buying the product to supplement their own products. Primarily it will be customers who develop either robots or other technical parts for them.  

\subsubsection{Revenue}
A revenue stream is generated through the sales channel to the various robot-developing companies, who end up providing the product to the end customers.

\subsubsection{Passion}
With a Belbin team profile that covers most roles, except a very weak shaper role, the group is balanced well. One of our main strengths is the analytical skills and assets of our specialists, which form more than half of the team.  

With expert skills such as programming, knowledge within the field of robots, software designing and knowledge of lasers and physics, each development challenge should be within our area of expertise. Progress makes motivation and drive for members of our team. 

Our product gets developed by skills mentioned above and our interests are within this field. We know that modern technology supports our product, therefore we believe that it can be done, with our team.

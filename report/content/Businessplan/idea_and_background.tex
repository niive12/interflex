\subsection{Idea and Background}
This section briefly covers a description of the problem that we are trying to solve, and explains how we are going to solve it. It will also contain a short presentation of members of the team and an explanation as to why we are the perfect fit for this start up company.

\subsubsection{The Team}
We are a dedicated team of engineering students. We believe that we have the drive and expertise necessary to realize this project. This project is an extension of our individual interests and as such it is only natural that we extend this to our professional careers. Below is a presentation of all of the members of the team.

\subsubsection{Passion}
With a team profile that covers most roles, the group is well balanced. One of our main strengths is the analytical skills and assets of our specialists, which form more than half of the team.  
With skills such as programming, knowledge within the field of robots, software design and lasers, each development challenge is within our area of expertise. 
Our motivation is the very real possibility that we will create a product that will provide the industry with a highly flexible welding solution. It may also provide the basis for an entirely new application of existing technologies that could be employed in many other industries.
It is our conviction that we are the right team to bring together this range of technologies to create something new, exiting and potentially highly lucrative.

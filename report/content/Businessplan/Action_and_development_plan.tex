\subsection{Action and Development Plan}
\subsubsection{Strategic Plan}

With this Strategic Plan we will try to define our objectives, politics and actions we will take in a long-medium term period (5 years approx). It is getting more and more important having a well defined Strategic Plan, here are some factors which prove it:\\
	- Acceleration of technological change\\
	- Increasing complexity of the managerial activity\\
	- Increasing complexity of the external environment\\
	- A longer interval between future results\\
Without an appropriate Strategic Plan, it is easy to find with excesses of contingency, an absence of a measure to control the real success or failure of an administration or lack of criteria for deciding new investments and expenses to carry and control.

\textbf{Mission}\\
The Interflex mission is:
Helping companies to achieve greater flexibility in welding processes, while we focus on technology investment.\\

With a fresh perspective on its mission and the environment in which we operate, Interflex will pursue the following strategic direction:\\
	- Interflex will review and deepen its existing direct supports and services over time to ensure that we are working effectively with our customers.\\
	- Interflex will further assess direct consumers needs to identify gaps or needed shifts in service delivery. This assessment will serve as the basic for expanding or adding new services.\\
	- Interflex will emphasize building its its discretionary financial resources to invest in providing quality services. This include developing new technology and establishing new trade relations, in order to obtain greater capital investment.

\textbf{Goals}\\
1- Department of marketing\\
Greater participation and market consolidation in Danish market, through actions that would achieve differentiation welding robots such as high-value and useful products.\\
2- Department of financial management\\
Purchase accounting software that helps to control and order of financial records, to minimize the waiting time for results or statistical data and financial statements of the company.\\
3- Management area\\
Design an organizational plan that contributes to the development and implementation of all activities, operations and business goals by generating an essential control tool for timely decision making.\\
4- Department of services, repair and maintenance\\
Better manage service plans for a set period, which will allow the company to increase profitability according to business requirements.

\subsubsection{Tactical Plan}
Once we have defined all our goals and tactics in a medium to long term, it is time to design the tactical plan. To do this we must make a projection of current activities and development, and make a prognosis and planning of new programs and business operations for the future. At this stage we will define the objectives, tactics, programs and budgets that will conduct the company. This is process by which detailed plans are carried out, taking into account the development of resources for Strategic Planning.

\textbf{Objectives}\\
Our objectives in the medium-short term (a year approx) will be the next ones:\\
	- Get funding to create and start developing the company.\\
	- Develop the capacity to compete in the marketplace technology.\\
	- Consolidate the company through the support of our main customer, Valk Welding.\\
\textbf{Tactical programs}
1.1 Marketing program\\
	- Challenge the national market with products of the company.\\
1.2 Production program\\
	- Develop and implement the technology needed to obtain the final product.\\
	This is a plan for the first year, so this is what we are looking for. Next years we will have different problems in this 	   area, but right now, we should focus on developing the product. We will have time to optimize the production process during the next years, but first we need to have the product.\\
1.3 Staff development program\\
	- Train the staff in order to be able to develop all our processing plan.\\
	As it is a new technology, we must train operators to be capable of working with the necessary machinery.\\
1.4 Financial program\\
	- Funding and reduce costs.

\textbf{Tactics and costs}\\
1.1 In order to challenge the national market, we are going to make a market analysis to know what exactly they are looking for. We are going to call them and see what they need, so we can modify our robot in a future. It also will help Valk Company to sell our robots, if we show them our result of our market analysis.
1.2 SOME TACTICS TO DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY?
1.3 Valk Comapany will provide us some training courses for the operators who need training on advanced programming about welding. FINISH WITH THIS PART (1.3 AND 1.4)

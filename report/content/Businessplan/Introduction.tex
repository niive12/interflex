\subsection{Introduction}
This is one of the main parts of the project. Here will be described everything about the business plan, i.e. all the information the company needs, in order to conduct the business. The company must take into account different factors to take precedence over all risks and threats that may arise. Competition in the welding market is fierce, so we need to define exactly everything about our idea to compete against competitors. Unable to deal directly with multinationals, we must define our business idea and the customers we will want to have, in order to survive in this market. It will also be discussed in this section all risks to which they arise.

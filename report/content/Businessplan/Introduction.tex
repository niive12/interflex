In this section the business plan will be described in detail. 
It includes all the required information the company needs to conduct its business. 
The company must take into account different factors to take precedence over all risks and threats that may arise. 
We need to define our business strategy in order to compete in the industry. 

We investigated the problems by following the Osterwalder business model.
In figure \ref{ost_business_model} the overview is shown. 
The business plan provides a lot of important questions that a company should be able to answer.
Any potential risk that endanger this idea from being a reality is described and dealt with in this report.

\subsection{Business Model}
The business model provides a short overview of the business plan. It will assist the company in creating, delivering and capturing value in economic and other contexts. It is also useful to represent core aspects of a business, such as, purpose, target customers, strategies, etc.  The model is divided into 9 categories:

    {\scriptsize \textbf{Key Partners:}\\ 
We want partners like Valk Welding who are suppliers of robot welding systems with a broad network. For hardware, no specific supplier is intended.

	{\scriptsize\textbf{Cost Structure:}
There are fixed costs in rental of premises, employees, etc. A big part of the cost structure is variable, it varies with the revenue. Like procurement of supplies which is coherent with sales.

	{\scriptsize\textbf{Revenue Streams:}\\
A revenue stream is generated through the sales channel to the various robot-developing companies, who end up providing the product to the end customers.
We will develop our product for specific welding robots for a price, providing another potential revenue stream. 
% Patenting the product will be also an important part to maintain revenue, as it will allow us to charge a significant sum of money from companies who wish to use our technology.

Initially, the main activity will be development of concept, after which our focus will shift to manufacturing of the product. 
The concept will be continuously improved to fit the market optimally.

In the development phase we need start-up capital. Reliable suppliers is a must in order to have a reliable business. A robot welding company as partner is required.

We offer a flexible way to program welding robots. It provides quality welding, efficiency, easy setup and training, reduced need for quality controls and a significant reduction in labour hours.

End users buy our product through welding robot companies/sellers. We will be participating in relevant conferences with partners. 
A website will be provided with the technical information of product, videos, contact information, etc.

      {\scriptsize\textbf{Customer Segments:}\\
Relevant customers are: Companies who are already in the field of robotic welding or companies who could be interested in buying the product to supplement their own products. 
Primarily it will be customers who develop robots.  
Our end users will be SME's who do welding with a small production run.

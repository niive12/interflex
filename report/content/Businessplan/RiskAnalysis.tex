\subsection{Risk analysis}
\label{risk}


Table \ref{riskshort} shows the worst risks that we think can go wrong in the project (a full list of risks can be seen in appendix \ref{riskapp}). We have evaluated what consequence these different risks have to the project and the probability for them to happen. To see an illustrative overview of all risks with their respective consequence and probability see figure \ref{cxp}. As seen in the figure we only mention the risks which is in the red area of the diagram.

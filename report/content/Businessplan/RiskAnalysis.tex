\subsection{Risk analysis}
\label{risk}
It has been important for the project to research the risks that could affect the project. 

Table \ref{riskshort} shows the risks that we think can affect the project. 
We have evaluated what consequence these different risks have to the project and the probability for them to happen.
"Initiatives for consequences" is describing what to do for lowering the level of the consequence.
"Initiatives for probability" explains what initiatives that will reduce the probability for the risk to happen. 
To see an illustrative overview of all risks with their respective consequence and probability see figure \ref{cxp}. 
As seen in the figure we only mention the risks which is in the red area of the diagram.

\section{Introduction}

This project has been focusing on developing a business plan for Interflex. It also collects information about how the team has worked since it began generating ideas, until the final draft was completed, as this project is part of the course Experts in Team, which has an important didactic purpose. This project has addressed issues from the analysis of markets and customers, to the different techniques for developing and improving teamwork.

Nowadays, companies demand flexibility to adapt at the existing market. Therefore, the idea of providing companies of this quality took great importance and seeing that the market for this type of machines was relatively small, the Interflex  company chose to strive to develop this idea.

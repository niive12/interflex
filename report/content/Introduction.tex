This project has addressed issues from the analysis of markets and customers, to the different techniques for developing and improving teamwork.

% Nowadays, companies demand flexibility to adapt at the existing market. Therefore, the idea of providing companies of this quality took great importance and seeing that the market for this type of machines was relatively small, the Interflex company chose to strive to develop this idea.
Companies use welding robots to keep up with the demand for a fast production.
We want to make it easier for the welding companies to change their products so the variety is bigger and the companies can be more flexible.
This requires a new way to program the welding robot.

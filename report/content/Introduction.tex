\section{Introduction}

This report contains a business plan for Interflex, that should legitimize how the company is going to make profit and why future stakeholders should invest in Interflex. 
We have documented how the team has collaborated as this project is part of the course Experts in Team.
This project has addressed issues from the analysis of markets and customers, to the different techniques for developing and improving teamwork, while having the main product to sell in focus.

Robotics have changed the industrial area, due to the effectiveness of automation. But the complexity of automation and robotics are causing costs to the end users in form of time and money. Every time a specific robot needs to solve a new task, a new program has to be made for this robot. This is not a flexible way of handling tasks. 

Our project is narrowed down to the area of welding within an automated industry. Within this area we want to establish a product that provides flexibility to welding robots, so they ease the step of reprogramming when a new task occurs. Programming robots is a complex process, that requires technical skill. This is not a cheap process either, so the end users would like to avoid the process of reprogramming, also due to consumption of time. If this process can be avoided or made easier, the end customers can save a good amount of money. Because this solution is a new product on the market, it is going to end up in the blue ocean, where the competition is low. Low competition means a higher chance of survival for our project and company.

In short, what is sought with this project is to create a business plan, as well as learn new techniques of collaboration and innovation, drawing conclusions from the results.

\section{Introduction}

% This report contains a business plan for Interflex, that should legitimize how the company is going to make profit and why future stakeholders should invest in Interflex. 
% This project has addressed issues from the analysis of markets and customers, to the different techniques for developing and improving teamwork, while having the main product to sell in focus.

Welding robots have changed the industry, due to the effectiveness of the automation they provide. However, the complexity and high cost of traditonal robotics solutions exclude many companies from being able to afford these solutions. This report will explain the development of a product that will help alleviate this problem.

Our project is narrowed down to the area of welding within the production industry. Within this area we want to establish a product that provides flexibility to welding robots, so they ease the step of reprogramming when a product needs to be manufactured. Programming robots is a complex process, that requires technical skill. If this process can be avoided or made easier, the end customers can save a good amount of money. 

The product itself is an add-on for welding robots, that allow the robot to detect welding seams with minimal user interaction. The add-on will provide coordinates, used to create a welding-path for the robot. The product consists of a micro computer, which is used to make calculations based on input from a camera and a laser range scanner. 

What is sought with this project is to create a business plan, understanding the process of starting a business, while learning new techniques of collaboration and innovation, and ending up drawing conclusions from the results.
We have documented how the team has collaborated as this project is part of the course Experts in Team.
